# Grav Topic Menu Plugin

`topicmenu` is a simple [Grav](http://getgrav.org) plugin that traverses a portion of a website, typically `/blog`, and creates a two-dimensional array containing a first level taxonomy and each second level taxonomy associated with them.

Said another way, it returns an array like this: `topicmenu_array[level_1][level_2]`. If the `level_1` taxonomy was a blog category and the `level_2` taxonomy was the post tags, youâ€™d have an array that listed all the tags that were associated with each category.

That array is then available to your Twig templates as the variable `topics_tags`.

# Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `topicmenu`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/bobrocke/topicmenu).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/topicmenu

> > NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) to function

# Usage
